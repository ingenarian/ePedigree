# ePedigree
ePedigree (electronic pedigree) is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) application architecture based on Java Standard Edition (JSE) 7 and Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) 6. It was part of a 2013-14 graduate research project to examine the pharmaceutical industry and supply chain application architectures that might comply to the United States Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA) - https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3204. To that end, there are four versions of the ePedigree application: stand-alone, client-server, jax-ws, and jax-rs. The stand-alone (SA) version is contained in the EPedigree_SA folder and it is based on the JSE 7, Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), and java serialization for data persistence. The client-server (CS) version is contained in the EPedigree_CS folder and it is based on JSE 7 concurrency and sockets to name a few. The jax-ws (WS) version is contained in the EPedigree_WS folder and it is based on JEE 6 SOAP, Servlet API (JSP), and TomEE etc. The jax-rs (RS) version is in the EPedigree_RS (Restful Server) and EPedigree_RSC (Restful client) folders. It is uses Spring, Hibernate, and GlassFish to name a few. Furthermore versions CS, WS, and RS utilize MySQL database server for data persistence. In addition, versions SA and CS were developed with the Eclipse IDE and versions WS and RS were developed with Netbeans IDE. The EPedigree.jar file is the run-time implementation of the SA version.
