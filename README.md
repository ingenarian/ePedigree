# ePedigree
ePedigree (electronic pedigree) is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) application architecture based on Java Standard Edition (JSE) 7 and Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) 6. It was part of a 2013-14 graduate research project to examine the pharmaceutical industry and supply chain application architectures that might comply to the United States Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA) - https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3204. To that end, there are four versions of the ePedigree application: stand-alone, client-server, jax-ws, and jax-rs. The stand-alone (SA) version is contained in the EPedigree_SA folder and it is based on the JSE 7 and Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and java serialization for file storage. The client-server (CS) version is contained in the EPedigree_CS folder and it is based on JSE 7 Concurrency and Sockets. The jax-ws (WS) version is contained in the EPedigree_WS folder and it is based on JEE 6 SOAP, Servlet API (JSP), and TomEE. The jax-rs (RS) version is in the EPedigree_RS (Restful Server) and EPedigree_RSC (Restful client) folders. It is uses Spring, Hibernate, and GlassFish. Furthermore CS, WS, and RS versions utilize MySQL database server for data storage.
