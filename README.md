# ePedigree
ePedigree (electronic pedigree) is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) application architecture based on Java Standard Edition (JSE) 7 and Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) 6. It was part of a 2013-14 graduate research project to examine the pharmaceutical industry and supply chain application architectures that might comply to the United States Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA) - https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3204. Furthermore, ePedigree is a sub-system of a larger intelligent sensory and telemetry application. ePedigree development will continue with JaDE/WaDE frameworks based on IEEE-FIPA compliant smart agent specifications and Niagara and Sendona frameworks for building automation systems [warehouses & facilities], intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and smart cities.

To that end, there are four versions of the ePedigree application: stand-alone, client-server, jax-ws, and jax-rs. The stand-alone (SA) version is contained in the EPedigree_SA folder and it is based on JSE 7, the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), and java serialization for data persistence. The client-server (CS) version is contained in the EPedigree_CS folder and it is based on JSE 7 concurrency, sockets, and Spring. It creates an ePedigree email server and email client for sending ePedigree documents. In addition, SA and CS versions were developed with the Eclipse IDE

The jax-ws (WS) version is contained in the EPedigree_WS folder and it is based on JEE 6 SOAP, Servlet API (JSP), and Tomcat (TomEE) etc. The jax-rs (RS) version is in the EPedigree_RS (Restful Server) and EPedigree_RSC (Restful client) folders. It is uses Spring, Hibernate, and GlassFish to name a few. Furthermore versions CS, WS, and RS utilize MySQL database server for data persistence. Furthermore, WS and RS versions were developed with Netbeans IDE. 

The EPedigree.jar file is the run-time implementation of the SA version. The EPCIS.war file is the run-time implementation of the RS and RSC versions. Please note that the EPCIS logic is located in WEB-INF folder. The index.jsp was a test page. In addition, I have included several Portable Network Graphic (png) files containing screen-shots of different aspects of the ePedigree application achitecture (SA, CS, WS, and RS) in action.
